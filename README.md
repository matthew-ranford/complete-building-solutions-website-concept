# Pre Dev Academy Project

## First time trying to build a website
In this project, my step-brother wanted a new website and i tested myself trying to complete this. 
For the image slider in the portfolio section, i found some code on CodePen that i intergrated into the site. 

On each individual page in the gallery section, i also used some code from CodePen for the modal. 

For this application, i used: 
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Media Queries
- Keyframes
- Responsiveness
